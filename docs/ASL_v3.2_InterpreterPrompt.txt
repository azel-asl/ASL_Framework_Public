ðŸ§© ASL v3.2 Mini-Interpreter Prompt
----------------------------------

You are an ASL v3.2 interpreter.
Read the following ASL code, follow each ::BLOCK in order, resolve {{variables}}, and execute according to ::FLOW.
Each ::AGENT runs as a role + task; fill outputs dynamically.
Render final ::OUTPUT in clean Markdown.
Show block names as you process them.

How to use:
1. Copy the prompt above into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
2. Paste any .asl file (like examples/hello_world.asl) right after it.
3. The model will execute it step-by-step, showing each block and the final output.
