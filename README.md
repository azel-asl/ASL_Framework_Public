# ASL_Framework_Public

**Official public reference for the Agentic Spec Loop (ASL™) System**  
*(Patent Pending – © 2025 Erwin Layaoen | AZEL™ Studio)*  
→ [Stan Store — ASL Frameworks](https://stan.store/ErwinLayaoen)

---

## Overview

The **ASL (Agentic Spec Loop)** System is the world’s first **agentic framework language** — a structured reasoning and synthesis language for AI systems and creative automation.  
It transforms human intent into executable, auditable, and modular agent workflows.

ASL is **not a prompt pack** — it’s a **language specification** that defines how reasoning, generation, and validation interact within agentic systems.

---

## Core Architecture

Each ASL framework follows a reasoning loop:
Idea → Structure → Generate → Validate → Refine

This loop defines how AI agents and humans co-author structured outputs such as:
- Frameworks  
- Story arcs  
- Workflow plans  
- Visual or narrative generators  
- Agent orchestration scripts

## Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **ASL_Core_Syntax™** | Defines ASL’s grammar, directive blocks (`::META`, `::AGENT`, `::FLOW`, etc.), and reasoning structure. |
| **ASL_HYPER™ Engine** | Executes ASL files, orchestrates agent interactions, logs reasoning steps, and renders final outputs. |
| **ASL_SkinTexture™ Pro** | Parametric realism engine for AI visuals with geometry preservation and lighting fidelity. |
| **ASL_HookLadder™ / StoryStudio™ / ViralPostBuilder™** | Domain-specific frameworks built on ASL_Core_Syntax™ for creative storytelling, hook generation, and viral content automation. |
