## 🧠 What Is ASL?

**ASL (Agentic Spec Loop™)** is a **plain-English, block-based language** that lets humans describe how an AI should think and act — step by step — without writing code.

It transforms ordinary text into structured instructions that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Mistral can **interpret and execute directly**.

Each `.asl` file represents a self-contained reasoning program.  
LLMs can read it, run it, and explain every decision it makes — making AI logic transparent and auditable.

ASL is part of the **ASL_Core_Syntax™** and **ASL_HYPER™** engine family, created by **Erwin Layaoen** under **AZEL™ Studio**.  
Patent filed **October 28, 2025** with the USPTO.

## 💡 Why It Matters

AI today is often opaque and difficult to verify.  
ASL solves this by introducing a **structured language for reasoning**, not just responses.  

- No programming required.  
- Runs inside any LLM — local, cloud, or hybrid.  
- Produces explainable, auditable AI workflows.  
- Designed for clarity, safety, and interoperability.  

In short:  
**ASL lets you describe intelligence, not just prompt it.**

---

## 🧩 Core Structure

Each ASL file is composed of **readable directive blocks**.  

| Block | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| `::META` | Defines name, version, and author |
| `::INPUT` | Lists variables or user data |
| `::AGENT` | Describes an AI’s role and task |
| `::FLOW` | Determines the order agents execute |
| `::OUTPUT` | Specifies what to display or return |
| `::ASL_CHECKSUM` | Footer for file integrity and audit |

All blocks end with `::END`.  
Variables can be referenced using `{{double_braces}}`.

## 🧩 Example — ASL 101 Demo

Copy-paste this into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to see how ASL executes:

```asl
/* ===========================================================
BEGIN — ASL_Inspired — v3.2 Demo
© 2025 Erwin Layaoen | AZEL™ Studio | Patent Pending
=========================================================== */

::META
Name: ASL_Inspired
Version: v3.2
Category: Narrative Reasoning
License: Public Demo
::END

::INPUT
idea: "Beginner wants to post but feels stuck"
format: "reel"
tone: "warm, encouraging"
::END

::AGENT analyze
role: Narrative Strategist
task: |
  Distill {{idea}} into:
    - core_emotion
    - audience_blocker
    - one-line promise
output: json
::END

::AGENT craft
role: Hook Writer
task: |
  Using {{analyze}}, write:
    3 hooks (≤ 12 words)
    and a short CTA in {{tone}} tone.
output: markdown
::END

::FLOW
RUN analyze -> craft
::END

::OUTPUT
{{craft}}
::END

::ASL_CHECKSUM

When executed, the model:
	1.	Reads each block.
	2.	Runs the agents in order.
	3.	Returns a structured, auditable output.

⚙️ Key Characteristics
	•	Plain-English Syntax: Understandable by both humans and LLMs.
	•	Executable: Runs natively inside language models — no runtime required.
	•	Auditable: Every step can be logged and reviewed.
	•	Modular: Extendable through future directives (e.g., ::CONNECT, ::DEFINE).
	•	Secure: Integrity verified by ::ASL_CHECKSUM and encryption hooks in private builds.
