# ASL™ — Agentic Spec Loop Framework  
*(Patent Pending • © 2025 Erwin Layaoen | AZEL™ Studio)*  

---

### Overview
The **ASL (Agentic Spec Loop)** Framework is a structured reasoning and creative synthesis language.  
It transforms natural ideas into systematic, modular outputs using explicit control syntax, reasoning stages, and adaptive context recall.

ASL is not a “prompt pack” — it’s an **intelligent framework language** that bridges LLMs, creative tools, and design systems.  
It emphasizes clarity, repeatability, and modular design across creative and technical domains.

---

### Core Concept
Each ASL session follows a loop:  
**Idea → Structure → Generate → Validate → Refine**

The loop defines how AI agents and humans co-author structured outputs such as stories, frameworks, visual prompts, or workflow plans.
